<!--
	Sets up Dianoga to act within the getMediaStream pipeline, causing synchronous image optimization
	
	This is less optimal than MediaCacheAsync because it blocks the page load time of the first visitor,
	while images are optimized. It is advantageous if you are planning to use a CDN where
	it needs the optimized image every single time.
