	By default this uses the PNGOptimizer library, which is fairly fast and can operate in memory.
	You may also enable quantization, which can result in larger file size savings at the cost of being lossy
	(usually a non-noticeable image quality reduction)

					IMPORTANT
					PNG optimizer uses a temporary folder to cache the optimizer DLL, to avoid locked files in the webroot.
					This path defaults to Path.GetTempPath(), which resolves in this order:
					1.- The path specified by the TMP environment variable
					2.- The path specified by the TEMP environment variable
					3.- The path specified by the USERPROFILE environment variable
					4.- The Windows directory 
					(see https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa364992(VS.85).aspx)
					
					If the application pool user does not have read/write rights to the selected temp folder, 
					optimization of PNGs will fail.
					
					Examples:
					<TempPath></TempPath> Use Path.GetTempPath() to select the temp folder
					<TempPath>~/temp</TempPath> Use the Sitecore /temp directory in the webroot
					<TempPath>C:\temp</TempPath> Isn't this one obvious? :)
